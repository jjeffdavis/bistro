USING CSS to insert text:

Here’s a simple example that inserts the words “Once upon a time:” before a
paragraph and “The End.” at the end of the paragraph (Figure 13-14).
The style sheet:
p:before {
content: "Once upon a time: ";
font-weight: bold;
color: purple;
}
p:after {
content: " The End.";
font-weight: bold;
color: purple;
}
The markup:
<p>Snow White was banished for being the most beautiful, ... and they
lived happily ever after.</p>
